The *AHU* Application behavior is controlled through these

Importing Master Driver Configuration Store
*******************************************
At the initial homepage, the user will be prompted to upload the **Master Driver** file. Values within the Master Driver Configuration Store will be parsed to provide options for Campus, Buidling, Device and Points throughout the application.

Once the user has selected the Master Driver Configuration Store, this homepage will not appear again. However, if the user needs to upload a different Master Driver Configuration Store at any point, this option can be accessed via the Menu icon in the top left of the application.

.. Warning:: Uploading a new Master Driver Configuration Store will remove all current data in the application.

After a *Master Driver* File is uploaded, there will be two new buttons that will appear 
as green below. 

Below The *Master Driver* button, there are two buttons that say:
*AHU File* and *Generate configuration file for...* The *Ahu File* will allow the user to submit a file that has been created by the AHU config 
previously, and the *Generate configuration file for...* will allow the user to create a new configuration file for either the *ECONOMIZER* or *AIRSIDE*.
